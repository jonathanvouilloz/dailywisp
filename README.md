# Wisp

A minimalist journaling app that helps you clear your mind through constraint.

**300 words. No stopping. No editing. Just flow.**

## What is Wisp?

Wisp is a daily brain dump for founders and creators who think too much. It uses a unique "ink gauge" mechanic: if you stop typing, your ink drains. If it empties, your session fades away forever.

This constraint forces you to write without overthinking — the key to unlocking flow state.

## Features

- **Ink Gauge** — Keep writing or watch your words disappear
- **100% Private** — All data stays in your browser (IndexedDB)
- **Mood Tracking** — Record how each session felt
- **Streak Calendar** — Watch your progress grow over time
- **Dark Mode** — Easy on the eyes, day or night
- **No Account Required** — Just open and write

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit 2.x
- Dexie.js (IndexedDB)
- Vanilla CSS
- TypeScript

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Design Philosophy

Wisp follows a "Zen Cozy" aesthetic:
- Warm neutral tones
- Slow, fluid animations
- Serif typography for content
- Desktop-first experience
